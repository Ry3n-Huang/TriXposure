## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
# 1) clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/Ry3n-Huang/TriXposure.git
$ cd TriXposure

# 2) fire up the server
$ python app.py              # visits http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

## Browser support
For the best experience, open TriXposure in Google Chrome. Safari’s autoplay restrictions can block the looping hero video on the home page, leaving only a static background.
